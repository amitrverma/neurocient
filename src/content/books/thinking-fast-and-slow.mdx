## Why It Matters  

Kahneman’s landmark book explains how our “fast” instinctive System 1 and slower rational System 2 shape choices.  
For **loss aversion**, it highlights why losses hurt roughly *twice as much* as gains feel good.  

---

## Key Ideas  

- **Prospect Theory** → losses loom larger than gains.  
- **System 1 vs. System 2** → instinctive vs. deliberate thought.  
- **Biases** → planning fallacy, anchoring, availability heuristic.

## My Take  

This book reframes “irrationality” as the predictable output of ancient survival programs.  
It’s foundational to *Inner Caveman*: our minds aren’t broken, they’re optimized for another world.
