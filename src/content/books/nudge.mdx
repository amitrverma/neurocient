## Why It Matters  

*Nudge* shows how small shifts in choice architecture help people make better decisions without forcing them.  
It’s about designing environments that account for bias rather than fighting against it.

## Key Ideas  

- **Choice Architecture** → the way options are presented changes outcomes.  
- **Defaults Rule** → people stick with default options.  
- **Libertarian Paternalism** → preserve freedom, shape behavior gently.

## My Take  

This book connects directly to *Microchallenges*: don’t rely on willpower, build nudges.  
It validates the strategy of working with wiring, not against it.
