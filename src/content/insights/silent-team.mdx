I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve opened a meeting with an invitation: *“I’d love to hear your thoughts.”*  
And then… nothing.  

A pause that stretches too long.  
A polite nod. Maybe a question that doesn’t go anywhere.  
But rarely the honest, unfiltered opinions I was actually hoping for.  

In those moments, it’s tempting to wonder whether I’ve been unclear, whether the team isn’t engaged enough, or whether people are just holding back out of fear. But over time, I’ve come to see this dynamic not as a failure of engagement or courage, but as something older—much older—at play.  

Because in that quiet meeting room, behind the laptops and notepads, there’s still a Caveman in the Cubicle.  

And he’s following instincts that have been shaped over tens of thousands of years.

## The Silence Beneath the Surface

Most leadership advice assumes that people are rational actors. Tell them it’s a “safe space,” put up a poster about “psychological safety,” and they’ll open up. But people are not just thinking machines—they are feeling, wired organisms running on an ancient operating system.  

One of the oldest programs in that system is status detection. Our ancestors lived in small groups where recognizing and respecting hierarchy was not optional. Misjudging the pecking order could mean humiliation, injury, or exile—the kinds of mistakes that could end your chances of survival and reproduction. Over generations, natural selection etched into our brains a deep sensitivity to rank and power.  

Neuroscientist Michael Gazzaniga has described this as the work of the *social brain*, always scanning for hierarchy and cues of dominance. Robert Sapolsky’s long-term studies of baboons show the same principle at work: status not only dictates access to resources, it cascades into stress levels, immune response, even life expectancy.  

So when someone senior speaks first in a meeting, it doesn’t just set the tone intellectually—it activates an ancient instinct. *Don’t challenge up. Don’t risk standing out. The safest place is near authority.* What looks like passivity on the surface is, in fact, a survival mechanism deeply wired into us.

## Why “Just Speak Up” Doesn’t Work

This is why simple exhortations—“Be open,” “Challenge ideas,” “Speak up”—rarely shift the silence. The rational brain might nod along, but the deeper, older brain is still scanning for risk. And it is far less interested in policy than in pattern.  

Who got praised the last time they disagreed? Who got ignored? Who got quietly punished? These are the data points that matter. As Amy Edmondson has shown in her research on psychological safety at Harvard Business School, teams will not take interpersonal risks if the social costs feel too high. It doesn’t matter what the poster on the wall says—the brain is paying attention to micro-signals in the room.  

Our instincts, in other words, still outrun our intentions.

## What Leaders Can Do Differently

Here’s the hard truth: you can’t deprogram a few hundred thousand years of evolutionary wiring. But you can design environments that work with it instead of against it.  

The first step is honesty. I’ve found it powerful to name what’s happening out loud: *“It’s natural to hold back when someone senior speaks first. We’re wired to read hierarchy, even if we don’t mention it.”* Strangely enough, saying this out loud lowers the temperature in the room. People stop blaming themselves for hesitating, and leaders stop mistaking silence for disengagement.  

From there, subtle shifts in structure can open up space. Let the most junior voices go first. Rotate who facilitates. Collect ideas in writing before anyone speaks. These aren’t management tricks; they are ways of hacking an ancient bias that tells us to wait, to defer, to keep our real thoughts tucked away.  

And of course, nothing matters more than the behavior of the leader. If you’re in charge, your words weigh more than you think. Speak last, not first. Count to ten before filling the silence. And when someone dares to disagree, don’t just tolerate it—thank them, publicly, for the courage. Because every time dissent is rewarded rather than punished, it rewires the group’s threat response. Over time, new instincts take hold.

## Leading Humans, Not Just Employees

What all of this has taught me is simple: when teams go quiet, they are not being passive-aggressive, disengaged, or unimaginative. They are being human. They are responding to the same deep wiring that kept our ancestors safe around the fire.  

And so leadership, in the end, is less about demanding honesty than about designing for it. It means practicing not just emotional empathy—“I hear you, I feel with you”—but what I call evolutionary empathy: the humility to recognize that beneath the modern job titles and open-plan offices, we are still creatures of hierarchy and survival.  

When we build spaces that respect this wiring, something remarkable happens. The filters drop. The silence lifts. And the real conversation begins.
