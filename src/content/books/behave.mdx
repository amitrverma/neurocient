## Why It Matters  

Sapolsky dissects human behavior across timescales — from neurons firing in a second to evolutionary pressures over millennia.  
He shows how Stress, hormones, and environment intersect with instinct.

## Key Ideas  

- **Context Matters** → behavior depends on biology + situation.  
- **Hierarchy & Stress** → rank affects cortisol, health, and decision-making.  
- **Ancient Adaptations** → instincts shaped for Survival still run the show.

## My Take  

This is the most comprehensive biological map of human behavior I’ve read.  
It deepens the *Inner Caveman* thesis: instincts are layered, contextual, and not easily “trained away.”
