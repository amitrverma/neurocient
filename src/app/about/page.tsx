      <h1>About Neurocient Labs</h1>
      <p><em>Mastering the science of human behavior, without fighting human nature.</em></p>

      <p>
        Hi, I’m Amit. For over two decades, I worked in technology — building
        platforms, leading engineering teams, and solving complex problems. It
        was rewarding, but I couldn’t escape a deeper puzzle:{" "}
        <strong>
          why do people — smart, capable people — struggle to act, even when
          they already know what to do?
        </strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        I saw it in myself, my colleagues, and in every system I built. The
        issue wasn’t laziness or willpower. It was wiring. Our brains evolved in
        a very different world, and they still run on that ancient operating
        system. That mismatch explains why so many of our struggles feel
        frustratingly familiar.
      </p>

      <p>
        That question pulled me out of the comfort of tech and into
        neuroscience, psychology, and evolutionary biology. I devoured research,
        spoke with scientists, and tested ideas in my own life. Slowly, I
        started to see patterns — not motivational tricks, but first principles
        about why we behave the way we do.
      </p>

      <p>
        Neurocient Labs was born to take that exploration further. It’s not a
        think tank or a coaching shop. It’s a place to experiment. To design
        tools, nudges, and frameworks that work <em>with</em> our instincts,
        instead of against them. To bridge the gap between what science knows
        and what daily life demands.

      <h2>What We’re Building</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>The Modern Caveman</strong> → a program that helps people spot
          and rewire instinct-driven habits.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Caveman in the Cubicle</strong> → leadership development that
          decodes workplace behavior.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mind the Gap!</strong> → a weekly newsletter where I share
          reflections on human nature and change.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Human Side</h2>
      <p>
        Outside the lab, I’m a parent, a runner, and a lifelong learner.
        Parenting taught me more about human instincts than any book. Running
        keeps me honest with my body. Reading keeps me curious about the world.
        All of it feeds into the same pursuit: understanding what it really
        means to be human, here and now.
