## Why It Matters  

Lencioni outlines five common breakdowns that cripple teams — absence of trust, fear of conflict, lack of commitment, avoidance of accountability, and inattention to results.

## Key Ideas  

- **Trust First** → without vulnerability, teams collapse.  
- **Healthy Conflict** → avoiding conflict leads to mediocrity.  
- **Shared Goals** → alignment beats ego.

## My Take  

This book translates caveman instincts into workplace dysfunctions: fear of exclusion, status anxiety, conflict avoidance.  
It’s a bridge text between *The Modern Caveman* and *Cubicle*.
