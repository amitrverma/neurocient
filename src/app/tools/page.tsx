      Your brain runs on ancient wiring. Long before offices, deadlines, and
      smartphones, our ancestors relied on instincts that kept them alive in
      small tribes. Those instincts haven’t gone away—they’re still in you
      today.
      <br /><br />
      We call this your Inner Caveman. It’s the part of you that seeks safety,
      status, belonging, quick rewards, and certainty—whether or not those
      instincts actually serve you in modern life.
      <br /><br />
      Spotting your caveman is about noticing those moments when your ancient
      wiring takes the wheel:
      <br /><br />
      – When one piece of criticism outweighs ten compliments. <br />
      – When you check email instead of tackling strategy. <br />
      – When you hold back an idea in a meeting to avoid standing out.
      <br /><br />
      By spotting these moments, you begin to see the patterns. And once you
      see them, you can start working with them—designing habits, environments,
      and choices that align with how your brain actually works.
      <br /><br />
      This isn’t about fighting your caveman. It’s about recognizing him, and
      learning how to steer with—not against—your wiring.

      Microchallenges are tiny, science-backed experiments for your daily life.
      They’re not about willpower or discipline. They’re about nudges—small,
      doable actions that work with your ancient wiring instead of against it.
      <br /><br />
      Your ancestors didn’t count calories, schedule gym sessions, or manage
      digital distractions. But they did walk often, pause at sunset, drink
      water when thirsty, and connect face-to-face. Microchallenges are built
      from those timeless patterns, translated into modern habits.
      <br /><br />
      Each challenge is intentionally small: drink a glass of water before your
      first coffee, put your phone away 30 minutes before bed, take a 5-minute
      movement break every hour.
      <br /><br />
      This isn’t about adding pressure. It’s about experimenting playfully with
      your wiring, one small challenge at a time.
