## Why It Matters  

Lieberman explains how our bodies evolved for ancient environments and why that creates mismatch today — from obesity to back pain to diabetes.  

---

## Key Ideas  

- **Evolutionary Mismatch** → modern lifestyle vs. ancient design.  
- **Movement & Diet** → our bodies expect activity and simple foods.  
- **Health Consequences** → mismatch fuels chronic disease.

## My Take  

This book gave me the clearest biological framing for *The Modern Caveman*.  
It underpins why microchallenges (like moving every hour) are about restoring natural patterns, not hacking habits.
