## The Ancient Program Beneath Your Day

You plan to sleep early—then scroll for approval. You promise to give feedback—then avoid the hard conversation. You want to start—then your brain sells you a “better time.”

This isn’t a personal flaw. It’s your Inner Caveman: ancient survival programs (threat detection, comfort seeking, social approval) running on modern inputs. What once kept tribes safe now misfires with phones, calendars, and inboxes.

## Why It Exists

For 200,000 years, the brain prioritized anything that reduced risk to food, status, and belonging. Today, those same instincts still steer attention and decisions—even when stakes are symbolic.

- Threat: avoid conflict, delay exposure, over-prepare
- Comfort: reach for sugar, scrolling, or escape
- Approval: seek signals that you remain accepted

## Spot Your Caveman

Try naming the instinct in-the-moment:

<CavemanSpot title="Name it to see it" items={["Threat: ‘What if I look foolish?’", "Comfort: ‘Just 2 minutes of scrolling.’", "Approval: ‘I need another sign they liked it.’"]} />

Then reduce perceived threat and take a tiny step—one that is so small your brain can’t object.

<MicrochallengeBox title="A Tiny Rep" description="Send a 3-line draft, not the final memo. Start a 2-minute timer and open the doc. Ask one concrete question instead of avoiding the meeting." />

## Work With It, Not Against It

The move isn’t to overpower wiring; it’s to pair safety with action.

1. Label the instinct (Threat/Comfort/Approval)
2. Shrink the step until resistance drops
3. Add a safe cue (timer, template, buddy)
4. Repeat daily to update the pattern
